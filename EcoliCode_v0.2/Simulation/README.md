# <i>E. coli</i>Code Simulation

This Simulation directory contains a simulation programs that may be generated by compilation of L++ source code including population of <i>E. coli</i>.   

## How to run  simulation programs

### Lab.py 

Lab.py contains population simulations of E coli. E coli simulation is imported from Ecoli.py. Based on the type of experiments, the simulations can generate the following results:
- Growth Curve (population) 
- Gene Repression ("Repression efficiency vs Relative growth rate")

Select the experiment before running the code.
    
    SelectExp = 1

    if SelectExp == 0:     # Growth curve (control only)
    elif SelectExp == 1:   # Growth curve with three populations (control, half protein synthesis rate, half cytokinesis rate)
    elif SelectExp == 2:   # Repression efficiency vs Relative growth rate
    elif SelectExp == 3:   # Show both 'growth curve with three populations' and 'Repression efficiency vs Relative growth rate'

### Ecoli.py 

Ecoli.py allows single <i>E. coli</i> simulation. FEcoliSimulator imports its metabolic networks from Metabolism.py by adding reactions as below: 

    class FEcoliSimulator(FSimulator):
    ... 

    def __init__(...):
        ...
        self.Sim = Metabolism.ReactionSimulator()
        ...
        self.Sim.AddReaction(Metabolism.Glycolysis())
        self.Sim.AddReaction(Metabolism.PyruvateOxidation())
        self.Sim.AddReaction(Metabolism.TCACycle())
        self.Sim.AddReaction(Metabolism.NADH_OxidativePhosphorylation())
        self.Sim.AddReaction(Metabolism.FADH2_OxidativePhosphorylation())

### Metabolism.py

Metabolism.py contains a reaction simulator and reactions, as well as EcoliInfo.  
Note that, for debugging purposes, 'mini' <i>E. coli</i> which divides every 10 seconds may be turned on as below:
        
    class EcoliInfo:
        ...    
        MiniEcoli = True
